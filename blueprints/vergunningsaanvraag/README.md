# Vergunningsaanvraag
This is a generic process for permit applications which lets an applicant request a new permit, 
the request can then be checked for completeness and a decision to approve or deny the request can be made.

This is a very basic example process, customization of the process and tasks will most likely be needed to make use 
of this process.

No plugins are needed for this process.
