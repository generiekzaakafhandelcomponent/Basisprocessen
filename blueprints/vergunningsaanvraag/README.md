# Vergunningsaanvraag
This is a generic process for permit applications which lets an applicant request a new permit, 
the request can then be checked for completeness and a decision to approve or deny the request can be made.

This is a very basic example process, customization of the process and tasks will most likely be needed to make use 
of this process.

Currently, this process lets the applicant apply for a parking permit. Basic information is being filled in on the start
form of this process. There is a task to determine if the given information is sufficient to make a decision. 
After that a DMN model will determine the category for this request. The DMN has a very basic logic just as an example. 
After this a decision can be made which will have to be confirmed by another person to comply with the 4-eye principle.

No plugins are needed for this process.
